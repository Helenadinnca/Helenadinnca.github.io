### About me

I am an international student from Spain, currently studying Film Production at the University of Sunderland. I am a hard working, independent, and energetic person. Also,â€‹ I am able to handle multiple tasks on a daily basis, and I adapt well in any situation, working as a team or individually. In addition, I am a perfectionist so I always strive to complete tasks at the highest possible standard. I am very organised, optimistic, as well as being responsible, creative and dynamic. I am very adaptable and highly motivated, with my dedication and passion I believe I can succeed in a job role alongside my university studies.<figure>
